// Module Introduction

Hey there! In this section, we're going to explore how to figure out the sin(x+y) equation using a cool geometric method. This way of looking at things helps us understand the equation really well, so we won't forget it easily.

// Understanding sin and cos as Lengths

You probably know about sine and cosine, which have to do with triangles. But when the longest side(Hypotenuse) of a triangle is just 1 unit long, something interesting happens.

// Pictures to Help

Imagine a Right-triangle where one of the angles is (x+y). On the other side, there are two Right-triangles, one on top of the other, with angles x and y. This arrangement helps us see how sin(x+y) is connected to sin(x)cos(y) and cos(x)sin(y).
	
	
// How to Build It

Looking at the pictures, you'll see that sin(x+y) goes straight up, but sin(y) goes sideways. To figure out the vertical part of sin(y), we need to do a special construction.

You can play with the "Construct" and "Deconstruct" buttons to see how this construction works

// Finding the Angles

	Once we've built the entire figure, the next step is to figure out the angles inside the triangles. Drag and drop the angles where they fit and then hit submit.

// Figuring Out the Sides

When we know the angles, we just have to find out how long the sides are. 

Here's a tip: when the longest side(Hypotenuse) is 1 unit long, sin and cos tell us the lengths of the other sides.

Move the labels for the sides to the right spots and then hit submit.

// Understanding Similar Triangles

Okay, now we're going to talk about something called "similar triangles." It's like when two triangles are related to each other in a special way. Let's see how it works with the interactive thing below.

Try moving the sin(x) side around and notice how it gets  shorter. To figure out by how much, we're going to think about two triangles that look alikeâ€”one smaller and inside the other.

See, when you change the sin(x) side, its new length is the regular sin(x) length times the length of the inside triangle's slanted side(Hypotenuse).

// Changing the sin(x) Side

Now, let's use the similar triangles idea in the picture below. We want to find the right length for the changed sin(x) side. This is important for understanding the sin(x+y) equation.

In the animation, move the sin(x) side to the right spot and hit submit. Remember, there's some multiplying going on.

// Figuring Out sin(y) Side Parts

Remember how sin(y) is tilted? Well, we're interested in just the part that is vertical. The simualtion below will show you how that part is formed when we use sin(x) and cos(x) ratios.

// Bringing It All Together - The Last Equation

Now that we have the right parts for sin(x) and sin(y) sides, let's put everything in one place and see how the equation works.
